# Node.js Todo App
This is a simple Todo List application built using Node.js and Express. It is designed for basic task management.

### Features
Add and complete tasks on a single page.
Store both new and completed tasks in separate arrays.
Uses the Express framework for server setup.
Minimal CSS styling.

### Base Setup
Create an empty directory named todo-app.
Open your console, navigate to the directory, and run npm init to initialize the project.
Within the todo-app directory, create a new file named index.js—this is where most of our code will go.

###Server Setup
To get our server up and running, we’ll use Express, a minimalist web framework for Node.js. Install Express by running:

npm install express --save
